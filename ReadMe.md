The two most popular techniques for scaling numerical data prior to modeling are **normalization** and **standardization**.

**Normalization** scales each input variable separately to the range 0-1, which is the range for floating-point values where we have the most precision.

**Standardization** scales each input variable separately by subtracting the mean (called centering) and dividing by the standard deviation to shift the distribution to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

## standard deviatin bigger when difference are big
